        <h2>COUNTERMAN v. COLORADO (2023) United States Supreme Court</h2>
        <p>
          From 2014 to 2016, Billy Counterman sent numerous Facebook messages to
          a local singer, C. W., despite her attempts to block him, causing her
          significant distress with some messages alluding to violence. C. W.'s
          fear led to changes in her daily routine and professional life,
          prompting her to involve the authorities. Counterman's appeal against
          his conviction under a Colorado statute was rejected by both the trial
          court and the Colorado Court of Appeals, as they found his messages
          objectively threatening regardless of his awareness of their impact, a
          decision upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court.

        <h2>BARTENWERFER v. BUCKLEY (2023) United States Supreme Court</h2>
        <p>
          Kate and David Bartenwerfer remodeled and sold their jointly owned
          house in San Francisco, with David primarily managing the project.
          Despite attesting to disclose all material facts about the property,
          they failed to reveal defects to buyer Kieran Buckley, leading to a
          successful lawsuit against them in California state court. When the
          Bartenwerfers filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Buckley pursued an
          adversary complaint to prevent the discharge of the debt owed to him,
          alleging fraud under the Bankruptcy Code. The Ninth Circuit ruled that
          Kate, despite lacking knowledge of the fraud, could not discharge the
          debt, invoking the legal principle that partners can't escape
          liability for each other's fraudulent actions.

        <h2>DUPREE v. YOUNGER (2023) United States Supreme Court</h2>
        <p>
          During his pretrial detention in a Maryland state prison, Kevin
          Younger alleges that Neil Dupree, then a correctional officer
          lieutenant, ordered guards to assault him, leading to a lawsuit under
          42 U.S.C. ยง1983 for excessive force. Dupree moved for summary
          judgment, claiming Younger failed to exhaust administrative remedies,
          which the District Court rejected, citing an internal investigation by
          the Maryland prison system as satisfying exhaustion requirements.
          Despite not presenting evidence on exhaustion at trial, Dupree
          appealed the rejection of his exhaustion defense, but the Fourth
          Circuit dismissed the appeal based on precedent requiring renewal of
          such issues in a post-trial motion.
