# Eskinder-Fitsum-Project-3

## Project #3

- For this project, you will add 2 media queries and 2 JavaScript tools.

- Deliverables & Milestones (see calender for due dates)

- First Deliverable: Use your Project One directory in Github to create a Project Two directory. You can branch it or create a new empty repostory and just copy and past your project 1 code. If you want to learn branching, seek help videos online. Create a new Basecamp post under "Project Three" with a link to your new directory. Your post should include:

- The URL to your Project 3 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages live link

- Eight screen capture images of successful validation. One HTML and one CSS validation for each website page (Use the live link to validate).

- Two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students

- Second Deliverable: Give constructive comments to help at least three other students. Post a picture of those three comments on your Basecamp folder.

- Final Deliverable: You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required fixes from the professor or TA. Fix your code and edit your original Basecamp post with the words "FINAL TURN IN".

## Requirements

- ALL THE REQUIRMENTS FROM PROJECT 1 AND 2 STILL APPLY!

- Fix any point reductions you received with Project 2:Final Turn in. They will be deducted again if not fixed.

- Pick one page to make mobile friendly. This means adding 2 CSS media queries with at least 5 CSS style changes under each. Use the min-width media queries.

- Add a fourth html page for your Google Maps api. The map should have 3 features added beyond the base code.

- Add one valid, error-free JavaScript file with your original code; linked from the head of all four HTML files

- Make sure your JavaScript throws no uncaught errors and is loaded unobtrusively. You can check for errors using the console on your browser inspector

- For the final turn-in, add a JavaScript picture slider to one of your pages.
